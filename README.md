Miscellaneous PCB designs

## BuLDOck

A Buck converter with LDO following it, for super clean DC output voltage. Recommended for noise sensitive applications such as audio equipment.

Designed on a single layer and with no holes, suitable for aluminum PCBs.

## PowerDistributor

A 2-layer board for DC voltage distribution. Designed for SBC cluster but might be used for anything.

Two M4 screw holes were designed to handle 30A power input. Eight pairs of screw terminals would usually serve as outputs, but that's not the law.

A center area is for properly rated capacitors - make more sense in low current applications.
